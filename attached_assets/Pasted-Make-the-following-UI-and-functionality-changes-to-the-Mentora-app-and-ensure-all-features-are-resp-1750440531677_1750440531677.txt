Make the following UI and functionality changes to the Mentora app, and ensure all features are responsive, polished, and work correctly across light/dark themes and mobile:

1. **Improve AI response formatting** in all study modes:
   - Apply better text formatting: use bullet points, spacing, bold key terms, and code block styling when needed.
   - Ensure readability and clarity in both light and dark mode.

2. **Remove the “Program Input (Optional)” field** in CodeLab mode completely.

3. **Fix the UI gap** between the Code Editor and AI Assistant window in CodeLab:
   - Reduce spacing
   - Ensure seamless alignment and unified design

4. **Add transition animations**:
   - Smooth animation when switching **to and from CodeLab**
   - Subtle hover/click animations across buttons and tabs

5. **Expand the chat area** in every study mode for better message visibility.

6. **Above the user input field in study modes**, add three quick action buttons:
   - `🧠 Explain`
   - `🧒 Explain Like I'm 5`
   - `🧬 Give Real-Life Analogy`

   These should send the current message context again to the AI with appropriate formatting:
   - “Explain this normally”
   - “Explain this like I’m 5 years old”
   - “Give a real-life analogy for this concept”

7. **Add a “Test Your Knowledge” button**:
   - When clicked, the AI hides its current output (blur or cover)
   - It asks 3 short questions based on the previous explanation
   - Once answered, the user can reveal the original answer for comparison
   - Optional: feedback like “Great job!” or “Here’s what you missed…”

8. **Add “Explain with Video” button** below every AI response:
   - When clicked, the AI searches for a relevant YouTube video
   - Returns 1 helpful, safe, and relevant YouTube video link with title and short description
   - Should work across study modes, CodeLab, and chat

9. **Mobile fixes**:
   - Ensure all the new elements scale well on smaller screens
   - Fix AI output box overflow/glitching issue when typing on mobile and receiving a response

Apply all changes cleanly with modular components and maintain performance. Ensure feature toggles for dev/testing if needed.
