Apply the following updates to the Mentora app UI and AI behavior:

---

🔧 **UI FIXES & IMPROVEMENTS**

1. **Center welcome message** in Notes view:
   - The message “Welcome to your notes. Select a note from the sidebar...” should be **vertically centered** in the notes viewing area (not near the top).

2. **Remove "Explain" button** above the input box in Study Modes.
   - Keep only:
     - `🧒 Explain Like I'm 5`
     - `🧬 Give Real-Life Analogy`
   - These should **actually work**:
     - “Explain like I’m 5” simplifies the previous response to a child-level explanation.
     - “Give real-life analogy” uses real-world examples to explain the concept clearly.

3. **Fix YouTube Video Button behavior**:
   - When clicking **"Explain with Video"**, the AI should not give a YouTube *search link*.
   - Instead, use the **YouTube API** or similar method to find and return a **specific video link** with:
     - Title
     - URL (clickable direct video link)
     - Short description (1 line)
   - Make sure the video is relevant, educational, and safe.

4. **Fix text on dashboard**:
   - Under Mentora logo/title, change “Your AI Companion” to:  
     **"Your AI Edu Buddy"**

💡 **RESPONSE QUALITY ENHANCEMENTS**

5. **Improve math formatting in AI responses**:
   - Use LaTeX-style or Markdown-style formatting for equations.
   - Add proper spacing and block formatting.
   - Structure responses clearly with:
     - Headings (e.g., `What is a Derivative?`)
     - Definitions
     - Examples
     - Code blocks (if needed)
     - Real-life analogy section (if triggered)

6. **General formatting cleanup**:
   - Ensure **bolding**, **spacing**, bullet points, and indentation are consistent.
   - Group similar sections together clearly.
   - Use soft background separators if needed for clarity.

📱 **Mobile & UI Polish**

7. Ensure all UI fixes work smoothly on **mobile**:
   - No glitching when the AI responds
   - Chat and CodeLab transitions should be animated and smooth
   - Responsive layout for smaller screens

---

Please make all changes modular, animated (where relevant), and ensure dark/light themes are supported. Use smooth transitions and modern UI polish across all study modes.
